Unit 3: Knowledge-based Agents using Propositional Logic
This unit introduces propositional logic as the language by which intelligent agents can represent knowledge and make
inferences. It builds significantly upon what was introduced in the Formal Analysis course. We observe how logic can be
used to create representations of the agent’s interaction with its environment, and how such representations can be
applied to deduce useful guarantees about an agent’s state.

Unit 4: Extending Agent Capability using Predicate Logic
Predicate logic is the focus of this unit, where propositional logic is enhanced with quantifiers to capture relationships
among agents and objects in their environment. We study ways that natural language sentences can be encoded using
predicates to allow an intelligent agent to make useful inferences about its environment. An important component of this
unit is the introduction of the Prolog programming language, which is used to encode predicates computationally and
make queries to ascertain new knowledge.

Unit 5: Robotics - Integrated AI for Manipulating the World Around Us
Having grasped the fundamental building blocks of intelligent agents, namely search and logical inference, this unit
rounds off the course by looking at robots as an advanced, state-of-the-art AI application domain. We study the various
components that go together to make robots, including hardware, sensors and actuators, and how AI is used to bring
these to life for manipulating the world around us. We also discover how modern AI approaches converge towards
machine learning techniques through an exploration of robot navigation in uncertain environments.

Course Policies and Assessment
Please refer to the following pages on myMinerva regarding general course policies and assessment:
https://my.minerva.edu/academics/policies/course-policies/
https://my.minerva.edu/academics/policies/course-grading-assessment/
For the details regarding the overall course score calculation in this course, please refer to the “Course Scoring” section
of this syllabus, above. The same information is reflected in the Outcome Index on Forum: from the "Courses" tab, click
on "View Course Score Calculation".
Course-specific Pre-class Work & Makeup Work Policies
Pre-class Work Policy:
The expectation of pre-class work in this course is that all questions are attempted. Where a student has difficulty with a
question in the pre-class work, they should write down what the difficulty was and not simply leave it blank. Selected
pre-class work will be graded throughout the semester. Pre-class work in which every question is not addressed, either
with a complete answer attempt or a description of the difficulty encountered, will receive grades of 2 or lower. Pre-class
work that is not attempted or very poorly attempted will result in a score of zero. The score of zero will also apply where
a link to the pre-class work is submitted instead of a pdf resource, which could allow modification after the deadline.
Make-up Work Policy:
There is no make-up work required formally for the course. However, students are encouraged to complete the preclass work for the missed sessions and also to watch the missed session recording to be able to fully participate in
future sessions. many of which build upon the foundation of earlier sessions.
