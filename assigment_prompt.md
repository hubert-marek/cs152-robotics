AI Final Project
In this project, you will be able to choose an aspect of AI to investigate further, based on your own interests. What you choose may well go beyond what was directly covered in class, but you must be able to demonstrate a link to one or more of the LOs for this course. You will be required to produce some kind of deliverable, like a Python/Prolog program, along with a report detailing your chosen problem, a description of your solution, and an analysis of your solution in action (i.e. simulation results). You will also have to nominate the LOs that you are targeting in the assignment - these will be the ones that you will be graded upon, so you may choose them based on those LO scores you would like to improve for your final class grade.

​

Project Proposal

​

Prior to commencing work on your project, you will have to come up with a short project proposal, and submit it to Prof. Shekhar for approval by filling out the form here. Your are required to provide the following information

Problem Definition: A one-paragraph description of the problem you are trying to solve using an AI method covered in this course, or an extension thereof.
**Targeted LOs: **Indicate the LOs from the course that you are targeting in your solution (primarily one or more of #search, #ailogic, and #robotics, with potentially #aiconcepts for certain projects). All projects will be graded on #aicoding by default except in exceptional circumstances, in addition to any other LOs you target.
Proposed Solution & Deliverables: Up to one paragraph describing how you plan to approach your problem. In particular, list the AI algorithm or solution method that you plan on applying in order to solve your problem, and the deliverable you will submit (e.g. a game simulator with an AI opponent).
It is in your interest to submit this proposal as early as possible, in case any changes are suggested to the scope of the project. Ideally, you will submit your proposal before the end of week 12 to allow you sufficient time to work on your solution. Projects must be approved before you commence work on them - if you do not do so and the scope of your project is inadequate, then it may substantially affect your grade. Please do not expect to submit a proposal in week 15 and get an immediate response. Since it may take some days to approve your project, you should allow adequate time!

​

Project Implementation & Report

​

Implement your solution according to your approved proposal and test it using different scenarios or datasets. The exact nature of your implementation and testing will depend on the project you choose. Then, write a brief report of no more than three letter size or A4 pages, (excluding references & appendices) with the sections detailed below. Grades will be awarded on the HCs/LOs indicated in square brackets. Where an HC is graded, you will also receive a corresponding score on the #HCScores LO.

​

Problem Definition: This will be an extended version of what you submitted for your proposal. It should detail the exact nature of the problem you are trying to solve, along with why this problem is interesting/significant, and why AI approaches are a good fit. [HC: #rightproblem].
Solution Specification: This section should describe your approach to solving the problem described in the problem definition section. It should detail the steps taken to solve the problem, including the AI method or methods that you have adopted, and how you applied those methods to produce your solution. [HCs: #breakitdown, #algorithms, LOs: will depend on those you nominated in your proposal].
Analysis of Solution: This section should present an analysis of your proposed solution operating on some relevant test cases. It should describe the test cases used, and relevant results using appropriate representations (e.g. tables and figures). [HCs: #modeling, #professionalism. LOs: will depend on those you nominated in your proposal]
References: This section should detail any references you used when formulating your problem or producing your solution.
Appendices: Include here any relevant appendices (e.g. Python or Prolog code). Also include a copy of your original proposal here.
AI Statement: Please describe in detail how you applied AI tools in this assignment. Please note that there will be no second chance to submit this if it is not included, and there will be corresponding grade penalties for this, so ensure that you do it prior to submission.
**HC/LO Appendix: **Include a description of how you have applied the course LOs and any HCs in producing your solution. Please note that LO scores can be reduced for poor or no justification included.
Submission Instructions:

​

Submit a copy of your report in PDF format, together with any source code or other media (if applicable) in a zip file or ipynb file. The PDF will be used for grading purposes, so please ensure you submit this as a separate file. Please note that your source code will be run for testing purposes, so ensure that you have provided appropriate instructions for how your code should be run. Functional code is a prerequisite for grades of 3 or above.

​

Notes:

Reports that are over length or poorly presented will be penalized on #professionalism, as will poorly-formatted or undocumented code.
All reference material must be cited. Submitted code will be checked for plagiarism using TurnItIn.
Grades of 4 and 5 will require demonstrated application and synthesis of the material covered during the course at a high level. The level of difficulty of the attempted project, the correctness and elegance of the solutions produced and the depth of understanding shown through the analysis of your results will be the main factors taken into account when awarding higher grades.
Project Ideas:

​

Some possible project ideas are listed below. They are only a guide - you may choose to attempt something quite different from what is listed here. In either case, you will have to formulate a proposal and submit it for approval.

Program an agent to navigate the Wumpus World and simulate it in a realistic way. That is, simulate it so the agent builds up its KB of percepts as it moves through the Wumpus World. This would target #aicoding, #ailogic and possibly #search.
Program an opponent for a game in Python and/or Prolog and demonstrate its performance against a human player. This would target #search (if using minimax with alpha-beta pruning or Q-learning) and potentially #ailogic.
Program a chatbot in Prolog, with an interface possibly written in Python. This would target #ailogic and potentially #aiconcepts, depending on what kind of analysis you carried out. Note that any chatbot implementation needs to go beyond the scope of the LBA to score well. That is, you would need to consider natural language capability or similar using DCGs in Prolog.
Program and demonstrate a small mobile robot performing a task involving sensing and actuation. Some of you have arduino / raspberry pi kits which you could use for this. This would target #robotics, #aicoding and possibly #search or #ailogic depending on the nature of the task. The deliverable in this case would be your control code, as well as a video of the robot performing its task. We haven’t started studying robotics yet, but will do so in week 12. Those of you that have access to development kits will be able to get started before then.
